# Face Generation with Generative Adversarial Networks
# ######################################################

This project aims to teach better understanding of GANs. The notebook starts with training a GAN on simple MNIST data set to generate numbers. Later we mature the network and train on face images to teach network to learn to generate face images. The project was completed as a part of Udacity deep learning course.

# Installation and Running
### Software Requirements:
- Python >= 2.7
- Tensorflow
- Jupyter notebook

### Running the notebook

```
jupyter notebook dlnd_face_generation.ipynb
